### Vax-man in Python with PyGame

This is a very minimal variation of the classic game Pacman. It has been modified in the following ways: The main character can eat (vaccinate) the ghosts. The still living ghosts split into 2 ghosts every 30 seconds. To win, the player must collect all of the morsels before the ghosts outnumber him (greater or equal to 128 ghosts).

The code base has been cloned and modified from https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman.git
